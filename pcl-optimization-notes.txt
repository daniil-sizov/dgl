## pcl optimization notes:
1. Most of out optimizations are to CopyReduce and BinaryReduce primitives
2. These optimizations are all written in dgl/src/kernel/cpu/binary_reduce_sum.cc
3. One minor optimization is also added in dgl/src/kernel/cpu/utils.cc
4. We have used Pytorch as the neural network backend for all our experiments
4. We have validated our optimizetions using gcc 7.1.0 & gcc 9.3.0
